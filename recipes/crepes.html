        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The ultimate crepe experience - Nutella Crepes!! Tender crepes slathered with Nutella and stuffed with strawberries, the only problem with these is portion control.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup / 150 g plain flour (all purpose flour)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups / 375 ml milk (I use low fat)</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>3 tbsp / 40 g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 tbsp white suga</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>2 tsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Nutella</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>Strawberries</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>Icing sugar / confectionary sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place Batter ingredients in a blender. Pulse 10 times, or until smooth and lump free</li>
            <li>Place Batter in fridge for 1 hour</li>
            <li>Heat a non stick skillet over medium high heat. Add 1/4 tsp butter and melt.</li>
            <li>Add 1/4 cup batter (Note 2) and quickly swirl to spread. Cook the first side for 1 minute or until there are light golden brown patches. Flip and cook the other side for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Slide out of the skillet onto a tray / board. Repeat with remaining crepes, overlapping them into the board.</li>
            <li>Spread Nutella onto crepe - as much as you want! Cover half the crepe with strawberry slices, then fold into half then into quarters. Transfer to plate. Sprinkle with icing sugar and serve with extra strawberries!</li>

        </ol>
